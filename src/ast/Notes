Time Worked:
	Built Up Hours: 30
	
	Thursday:
		11:00 - 
	
To Do:
	I'm thinking the way to handle this is when I'm building a statement or node in buildAST() and an exception arises
	from somewhere, I take note of it, pretend it was successful, then move on to the next statement.
	
	Maybe look for specific exceptions so you know what went wrong.
	
	Types of bad code:
		Missing vital word(s)
		Extra word(s) that don't fit
		Wrong word (missing the vital word, has an extra word that doesn't fit)
	
	
	
Questions:
	How to look for patterns that the user defines? Should I just write code for cases as we think of them or
	try to come up with a general purpose solution?

	What do you want to do with bad code? Do you want WebTA to find it automatically and
	come up with the best error report it can? How would we look at bad code to see if it's
	mostly good code?
	
	How do I want my reader(parser is not the right term) to function? Give Leo some ideas and see what he likes.
	Should I build methods that look for specific patterns?
	Should I build a method that looks at one type of node (user defined or not) for a pattern (like a missing Expr)?

Ideas:
	When reading bad code, bundle up the minimal amount of garbage necessary.
	Such as, public static main(String[] args), just bundle up the missing void as
	bad and move on. Try to read as much code as possible, don't let anything break
	the AST.
	
	How do I handle reading in all the possible methods for each object?
	For example String has a length() method and many others. - Use reflection
	
	VarDecl seems to be able to handle it just fine, but making TypeDecl might make parsing easier...
